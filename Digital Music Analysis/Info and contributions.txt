This was a project for the unit 'High Performance and Parallel Computing'. The original digital music analysis application was provided as starting point and sequential application, where the task was to parallelise the application (hence why there is a sequential and parallel module included). Parallelisation was done with the .NET task parallel library. The project had much more room for parallelisation and 'parallel speedup', but the key areas had been identified and refactored for parallelisation, taking the initial default execution time of 5 minutes down to ~3 minutes.
