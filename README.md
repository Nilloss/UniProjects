# UniProjects
I will note that I wouldn't consider these projects to contain an industry-acceptable use of programming principles such as naming conventions and or commentation. 
I merely aim to demonstrate understanding of key concepts, designs or structures through some of these contributions and implementations.

I've included a short summary file in each of the project folders detailing what the project was for and my contributions.
